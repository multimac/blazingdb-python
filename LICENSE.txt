1. EVALUATION LICENSE; TERM. This “Agreement” governs Evaluators use of the Blazing’s product and its associated software
and documentation (the “Product​”). Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Blazing hereby provides Evaluator, during the Term, a
non­exclusive, non­transferable, non­assignable, non­sublicensable right and license to install and run a single copy of the Product on
one (1) computer owned or controlled by Evaluator solely for the purpose of internally evaluating the performance and functionality of
the Product. Evaluator agrees to use and evaluate the Product and report on its operations to Blazing, for the period of time specified
by Blazing in writing, or if no such period is specified then for sixty (60) days after the date Evaluator accepts this Agreement (as
described in the premable above) (the “Term​”).

functionality of the Product (“Feedback​”). Such Feedback will include information about operating results, performance, known or
suspected bugs, errors or compatibility problems and user­desired features. Evaluator hereby grants to Blazing a perpetual,
irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable, and royalty­free right to use and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any manner. Blazing shall
not disclose Evaluator’s name or the name of any Evaluator employee to a third party in connection with any Feedback.

licenses (“Third Party Code​”). Such Third Party Code is opaquely embedded within the Product hardware and is not directly
accessible by, nor does it interface directly with, Evaluator’s software or products, thereby avoiding any open source licensing
contamination of Evaluator’s intellectual property. The Third Party Code is not subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
except for Sections 5, 9, 10 and 11 of this Agreement. Instead, each item of Third Party Code is licensed under the terms of the
license that accompanies such Third Party Code. Nothing in this document limits Evaluator’s rights under, or grants Evaluator rights
that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable license for the Third Party Code, including any rights to copy, modify, or
distribute Third Party Code under the applicable license. If required by an applicable license, source code for such software will be
made available by Blazing or its supplier upon written request.
5. TITLE. Blazing and its suppliers shall retain all right, title and interest in the Product and in all intellectual property rights
therein, including without limitation all patent, trademark, trade name and copyright, whether registered or not registered. No license
or other express or implied rights of any kind are granted or conveyed except for the limited internal license expressly provided above.
The Product shall remain Blazing’s sole and exclusive personal property. Evaluator shall not offer, loan, transfer, encumber, sell or
otherwise dispose of the Product to any third party without having received prior written authorization from Blazing.
6. TERMINATION. ​(a) This Agreement will expire at the end of the Term, unless terminated earlier. Either party may terminate

(other than normal wear and tear) while in Evaluator’s possession or resulting from improper handling or the use of un­approved
packaging.
8. EXCLUDED USES. Evaluator acknowledges that the Product is not designed or intended for use in life support, life sustaining,

LOSS OF PRODUCTION DATA. IN NO EVENT WILL BLAZING BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE
OF THE PRODUCT OR OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE PRODUCT OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY
OTHER CLAIM ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF BLAZING HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BLAZING AGGREGATE CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY HEREUNDER SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF $100.00 US DOLLARS. EVALUATOR AGREES THAT

business world exercise under similar circumstances. All Product related technical information, evaluation or reports supplied to or

irrevocable, worldwide, sublicenseable, and royalty­free right to use this diagnostic information in any manner and that Evaluator will
not interfere with the collection or transmission of such information to Blazing. For clarification, there is no actual user data of
Evaluator that is transmitted or provided to Blazing.
